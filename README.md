# PHP-SQL-online-exam-web-application
Hello,
This is a web application that i did for a course in PHP/SQL
The app is an online exam that a student can pass.
The student passes the test if he has at least 30 points, otherwise he doesn't pass it.
You can also connect as a teacher and see the different results of your students.
When you first arrive on the app you'll have to create a now teacher profile and add your students
